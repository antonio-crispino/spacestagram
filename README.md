# Spacestagram

**This website displays photos from NASA's "Mars Rover Photos API". These photos are displayed as posts along with their details. Users can view, like, and comment on these photos.**

**Main features:**
- Like/unlike posts
- Comment on posts
- Likes and comments are stored in browser's local storage
- Like button and comment field are animated
- Hover effects

**Upon observation of the code,** you will notice that it is semantic, clean, concise, organized, modular, documented, and allows for accessibility. Regarding accessibility (a11y): color, contrast, keyboard flow (tab/enter keys), screen readers, responsiveness, and other things were accounted for. I learnt about a11y in my Codecademy "Full-Stack Engineering" course that I'm currently taking on my personal time.

Although I enjoy using the ```React.js``` library to build web apps, I decided to build this website using purely ```HTML```, ```CSS```, and ```JavaScript``` to showcase my abilities without using any libraries or frameworks. I have used ```React.js``` in one of my internships and in one of my academic projects. You can see the details of these on [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/antonio-crispino/ "antonio-crispino"). (Upon request, I can gladly convert this website to a React web application that uses ```SASS```, etc.)

I loved working on this project and will most likely add more features to it in the future. There is always room for improvement because a great project never ends!
